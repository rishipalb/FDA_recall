# FDA_recall
## Introduction
The Department of Health and Human Services is the federal agency that oversees the United States Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED).

## What is a food recall?
A food recall occurs when a food manufacturer withdraws a product from the market because they have reason to believe that it may cause consumer illness. In some circumstances, government agencies may request or require a food recall. Food recalls can have many reasons, including but not limited to:

Detection of organisms including bacteria such as Salmonella and parasites such as Cyclospora, find foreign objects such as broken glass or metal. Discovery of major allergens not listed on the product label.

A food recall is the removal from the market of food that violates US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Food recalls are usually initiated voluntarily by the food manufacturer or distributor. In some cases, the FDA may request or order a recall.

## API_KEY
The ‘page’ UPC search uses RapidAPI access to enable ‘Edamam Food Database’. Ensure you enter your personal API_KEY=“PASSKEY” for the application to work as expected. Also, ensure to keep you personal API_KEY private and not share or make it public. One way is to make a .env file and enable .gitignore to prevent the .env file from being committed to the gitHub repository.
A dummy .env is made available in the repository.
